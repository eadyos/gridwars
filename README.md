Grid Wars Programming Competition Runner

Grid Wars was a programming competition that I once perticipated in.
[Competition History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridwars)

The competition is to create a program method that is run in cells on a grid as cellular automata.

Your program is run simultaneously with enemy programs that may exist in other cells.

Your cells are given as input, an array containg the state of your immediate neighbors, and your method returns on array which specifies wich cells you can shoot up to 3 bullets into.  Empty cells and enemy cells can be conquired by your program.

The goal is to have your program take up more cells than ther other executing programs when the test runner has finished executing.

I re-created the competition, including the test runner, so that my development team could enjoy the challenge as I once did.

It was implemented with haste using a raw html/javascript web client using a grails back-end API.
